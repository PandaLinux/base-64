# Introduction

Panda Linux is an `open-source` and `free` operating system. Panda Linux is a [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/source_code) based [Linux distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) based on `Debian/Ubuntu`.
It is built entirely by compiling source-code, using custom optimizations. It is designed primarily for developers and advanced users who are expected to take an active role in the development of the distribution.

Currently, Panda Linux only supports `x86-64` architecture.

### What we expect from our developers?

- We fully expect you to help with development or other parts of the project. In return you get to have lots of fun and learn some new things.
- You’re to think for yourself. `Panda Linux` is not a system where we document everything so you’ll need a basic understanding of how Linux systems work to be able to set up many things and work out problems efficiently when necessary.

# TODO

- We need a better logo for our system.
- Create an `ISO` image of the system.
- Create an ~~shell~~ installer to setup the system instead of using it as a `live` os.
- Thoroughly test the all the packages before the next release.
- `version-check.sh` script should exit upon error after checking all the programs instead of just one.
- Backup the system: pigz uses multicore to improve compression speed.
- Sometimes the installation stops while building temporary system, because the `variables` have not been sources properly. Adding a check at appropriate point while help eliminate this problem.

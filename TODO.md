# TODO

- We need a better logo for our system.
- Create an `ISO` image of the system.
- Create an ~~shell~~ installer to setup the system instead of using it as a `live` os.
- Thoroughly test the all the packages before the next release.
- `version-check.sh` script should exit upon error after checking all the programs instead of just one.
- Backup the system: pigz uses multicore to improve compression speed.
- The installation stops while building temporary system, because the `variables` have not been sourced properly.
